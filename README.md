# Slide In on Scroll

A project from [JavaScript 30 - 13](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)

This project is to learn how to build a slide in on scroll, that is, when you slide down, the images will slide themselves in from the left or from the right, and you can do whatever other animations you like to do.
